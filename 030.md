# Math rounding in AutoRoller.sol is not ERC4626-complicant: previewWithdraw should round up.

## Summary

Math rounding in AutoRoller.sol is not ERC4626-complicant: previewWithdraw should round up.

## Vulnerability Detail

Per EIP 4626's Security Considerations (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626)

> Finally, ERC-4626 Vault implementers should be aware of the need for specific, opposing rounding directions across the different mutable and view methods, as it is considered most secure to favor the Vault itself during calculations over its users:

> If (1) it’s calculating how many shares to issue to a user for a certain amount of the underlying tokens they provide or (2) it’s determining the amount of the underlying tokens to transfer to them for returning a certain amount of shares, it should round down.
If (1) it’s calculating the amount of shares a user has to supply to receive a given amount of the underlying tokens or (2) it’s calculating the amount of underlying tokens a user has to provide to receive a certain amount of shares, it should round up.

Then previewWithdraw in AutoRoller.sol should round up.

The original implementation for previewWithdraw in Solmate ERC4626 is:

```solidity
    function previewWithdraw(uint256 assets) public view virtual returns (uint256) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply; // Saves an extra SLOAD if totalSupply is non-zero.

        return supply == 0 ? assets : assets.mulDivUp(supply, totalAssets());
    }
```

It is rounding up, however in the implementation of the AutoRoller.sol#previewWith is not round up.

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < 20;) { // 20 chosen as a safe bound for convergence from practical trials.
    if (guess > supply) {
        guess = supply;
    }

    int256 answer = previewRedeem(guess.safeCastToUint()).safeCastToInt() - assets.safeCastToInt();

    if (answer >= 0 && answer <= assets.mulWadDown(0.001e18).safeCastToInt() || (prevAnswer == answer)) { // Err on the side of overestimating shares needed. Could reduce precision for gas efficiency.
        break;
    }

    if (guess == supply && answer < 0) revert InsufficientLiquidity();

    int256 nextGuess = guess - (answer * (guess - prevGuess) / (answer - prevAnswer));
    prevGuess  = guess;
    prevAnswer = answer;
    guess      = nextGuess;

    unchecked { ++i; }
}

return guess.safeCastToUint() + maxError; // Buffer for pow discrepancies.
```

note the line:

```solidity
  int256 answer = previewRedeem(guess.safeCastToUint()).safeCastToInt() - assets.safeCastToInt();
```

previewRedeem is round down.

and later we update guess and return guess

```solidity
    int256 nextGuess = guess - (answer * (guess - prevGuess) / (answer - prevAnswer));
    prevGuess  = guess;
    prevAnswer = answer;
    guess      = nextGuess;
```

and

```solidity
 return guess.safeCastToUint() + maxError; // Buffer for pow discrepancies.
```

when calculating the the nextGuess, the code does not round up.

```solidity
int256 nextGuess = guess - (answer * (guess - prevGuess) / (answer - prevAnswer));
```

## Impact

Other protocols that integrate with Sense finance AutoRoller.sol might wrongly assume that the functions handle rounding as per ERC4626 expectation. Thus, it might cause some intergration problem in the future that can lead to wide range of issues for both parties.
