# Zero approval missing

## Summary
Some tokens (like USDT) require first to change allowance to 0 before you can actually change the allowance to sensible value

## Vulnerability Detail
1. In `onSponsorWindowOpened` function, `safeApprove` is called over user provided token. 

```solidity
stake.safeApprove(address(periphery), stakeSize);
```

2. Observe there is no zero amount approval

## Impact
Function will fail for some tokens which requires 0 approval first

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
First approve 0 value before assigning correct approval value
