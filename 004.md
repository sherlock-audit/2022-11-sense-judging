# User has to pay twice

## Summary
While minting in RollerPeriphery.sol#L59, user transfer the amount to RollerPeriphery. But seems like vault.mint(shares, receiver) will also be transferring from user, making user to pay double

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Observe the `mint` function

```solidity
function mint(ERC4626 vault, uint256 shares, address receiver, uint256 maxAmountIn) external returns (uint256 assets) {
        ERC20(vault.asset()).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), vault.previewMint(shares));

        if ((assets = vault.mint(shares, receiver)) > maxAmountIn) {
            revert MaxAssetError();
        }
    }
```

2. As we can see the fund are transferred to this contract and then ERC4626 function `vault.mint(shares, receiver))` is called which again ask user to transfer funds, making double payment

3. This also need to be fixed for `deposit` function

## Impact
User will lose funds

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not pull money from user as this will already be taken care by vault.mint(shares, receiver))
