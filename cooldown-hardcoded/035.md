# Cooldown period is hardcoded to 10 days.

## Summary

Cooldown period is hardcoded to 10 days.

## Vulnerability Detail

In AutoRoller Documentation, I want to quote:

> Let’s go through an example: an auto-rolling 1-month duration pool. When the series matures, the auto-roller allows a “cool down” period during which exiting LPs incur no slippage (this could be any amount of time and could vary by adapter: perhaps 24hrs for a 1m series or 1 week for a 5yr series). Once the “cooldown” period concludes, the auto-rolling position will initialize a new 1-month series automatically, set a starting market fixed rate, and roll all of its liquidity into the new pool for that new series.

Basically the cooldown period depends on the maturity / length of the series.

but in the AutoRoller code, the cooldown period is hardcode to 10 days.

```solidity
uint256 public cooldown = 10 days; // Length of mandatory cooldown period during which LPs can withdraw without slippage.
```

## Impact

For example, if the length of the series is 1 days, but cool down period is 10 days, then 

the cooldown period is too long, the user's fund sits idle and does not generate yield.

If the length of the series is 6 months but the cool down period is 10 days, then

Ithe cooldown period is too short, the user does not have enough time to exit before their position is locked and rolled to next series.

Hardcode the cooldown is not a good idea, although it can be adjusted by the function setParams by admin, the admin can forget to do so or misconfigure the cool down period.

## Recommendation

We recommend update the cooldown period during the function startCooldown
