# onSponsorWindowOpened needs to require stake != asset

## Summary
onSponsorWindowOpened does not require stake != asset, Roller cannot withdraw stake tokens when stake == asset
## Vulnerability Detail
In the settle function, if stake == asset, Roller cannot withdraw stake tokens. However, there is no requirement for stake != asset in the onSponsorWindowOpened function. If stake == asset, the Roller will suffer losses.
```solidity
    function settle() public {
        if(msg.sender != lastRoller) revert InvalidSettler();

        uint256 assetBalPre = asset.balanceOf(address(this));
        divider.settleSeries(address(adapter), maturity); // Settlement will fail if maturity hasn't been reached.
        uint256 assetBalPost = asset.balanceOf(address(this));

        asset.safeTransfer(msg.sender, assetBalPost - assetBalPre); // Send issuance fees to the sender.

        (, address stake, uint256 stakeSize) = adapter.getStakeAndTarget();
        if (stake != address(asset)) {
            ERC20(stake).safeTransfer(msg.sender, stakeSize);
        }
```
## Impact
If stake == asset, the Roller will suffer losses.

## Recommendation
```diff
    function onSponsorWindowOpened(ERC20 stake, uint256 stakeSize) external {
        if (msg.sender != address(adapter)) revert OnlyAdapter();
+      require(stake != address(asset))
```
