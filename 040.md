# Missing ReEntrancy Guard to `claimRewards` function

## Summary
There is no re-entry risk on true ERC-20 tokens that work according to the spec (i.e. audited, etc.).

However you can write a malicious ERC-20 with custom safetransferFrom() or approve() that have re-entrancy hooks to attack a target.

Furthermore ERC-777 is backwards compatible token standard with ERC-20 standard. ERC-777 has better usability, but it has transfer hooks that can cause re-entrancy.


## Vulnerability Detail
ERC20 generally doesn't result in reentrancy, however ERC777 tokens can and they can maskerade as ERC20. So if a contract interacts with unknown ERC20 tokens it is better to be safe and consider that transfers can create reentrancy problems.

## Impact
Although reentrancy attack is considered quite old over the past two years, there have been cases such as:

Uniswap/LendfMe hacks (2020) ($25 mln, attacked by a hacker using a reentrancy)

The BurgerSwap hack (May 2021) ( $7.2 million because of a fake token contract and a reentrancy exploit.)

The SURGEBNB hack (August 2021) ($4 million seems to be a reentrancy-based price manipulation attack.)

CREAM FINANCE hack (August 2021) ($18.8 million, reentrancy vulnerability allowed the exploiter for the second borrow.)

Siren protocol hack (September 2021) ($3.5 million, AMM pools were exploited through reentrancy attack.)

Type of Reentrancy

[Details](https://inspexco.medium.com/cross-contract-reentrancy-attack-402d27a02a15)
1 - Single Function Reentrancy
2 - Cross-Function Reentrancy
3 - Cross-Contract Reentrancy


## Code Snippet

Must be re-entrancy guard to below functions;

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use Openzeppelin or Solmate Re-Entrancy pattern

Here is a example of a re-entracy guard

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.13;

contract ReEntrancyGuard {
    bool internal locked;

    modifier noReentrant() {
        require(!locked, "No re-entrancy");
        locked = true;
        _;
        locked = false;
    }
}
```
