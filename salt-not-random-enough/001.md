# Salt used in create is not random enough

## Summary
It is possible for 2 users to use the same param while calling `create` function at AutoRollerFactory.sol#L41 
Only the first caller with succeed, since both call will have same args for Create2 call

## Vulnerability Detail
1. User X uses create function with rewardRecipient as A, Target Duration T
2. User Y also wants to create an AutoRoller with rewardRecipient as A and Target Duration T
3. But User Y cannot create the same since User X has already deployed the contract.

## Impact
User Y will be forced, to use another user deployed AutoRoller (who has used up the rewardRecipient which User Y wished)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add nonce while creating AutoRoller which will prevent collision
