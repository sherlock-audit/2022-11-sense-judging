# Hardcoded divider address in RollerUtils is incorrect and will brick autoroller

## Summary

RollerUtils uses a hard-coded constant for the Divider. This address is incorrect and will cause a revert when trying to call AutoRoller#cooldown. If the adapter is combineRestricted then LPs could potentially be unable to withdraw or eject.

## Vulnerability Detail

    address internal constant DIVIDER = 0x09B10E45A912BcD4E80a8A3119f0cfCcad1e1f12;

RollerUtils uses a hardcoded constant DIVIDER to store the Divider address. There are two issues with this. The most pertinent issue is that the current address used is not the correct mainnet address. The second is that if the divider is upgraded, changing the address of the RollerUtils may be forgotten.

        (, uint48 prevIssuance, , , , , uint256 iscale, uint256 mscale, ) = DividerLike(DIVIDER).series(adapter, prevMaturity);

With an incorrect address the divider#series call will revert causing RollerUtils#getNewTargetedRate to revert, which is called in AutoRoller#cooldown. The result is that the AutoRoller cycle can never be completed. LP will be forced to either withdraw or eject to remove their liquidity. Withdraw only works to a certain point because the AutoRoller tries to keep the target ratio. After which the eject would be the only way for LPs to withdraw. During eject the AutoRoller attempts to combine the PT and YT. If the adapter is also combineRestricted then there is no longer any way for the LPs to withdraw.

## Impact

Incorrect hard-coded divider address will brick autorollers for all adapters and will cause loss of funds for combineRestricted adapters

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

RollerUtils DIVIDER should be set by constructor. Additionally RollerUtils should be deployed by the factory constructor to make sure they always have the same immutable divider reference.
