# The implementation allows for calling the startCooldown before calling the settle

## Summary
When we look at the function calling `settle()` , it  is sending issuance fees to the sender and then calling the `startCooldown.`

But `startCooldown` is external function and can be called by anyone. The maturity and other parameters are reset.

This mean that the new serious is ready for `roll()` once it's maturity period is crossed.

If the `settle()` is not called in this time time window, and next `roll()` is called, then the first roller will be overwritten by the new roller.

So the `issuance fees to the sender` may not be sent to first roller.

## Impact

Valid roller may not be able to claim the fee.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement mechanism such that once the lastroller claimed the fee, then allow for next roll.
