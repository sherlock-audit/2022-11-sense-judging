# Wrong logic in `roll()`

## Summary
Wrong logic in `roll()` causes the function to revert after cooldown period has elapsed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The check for `if (lastSettle + cooldown > block.timestamp)` should be `if (lastSettle + cooldown < block.timestamp)` instead. We want to revert only if the `lastSettle` time plus `cooldown` period has not exceeded current time.

## Impact
This issue breaks the rolling mechanism introduced by sense finance - high severity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change to `if (lastSettle + cooldown < block.timestamp)`.
