# Multiple address tokens can be withdrawn to `rewardRecipient` even they are the `asset` of the vault

## Summary
If the `asset` of the vault is a multiple address token, it can easily be withdrawn to `rewardRecipient` address. Same applies if the vault hasn't matured and the token is the `underlyingToken`

## Vulnerability Detail
Multiple address tokens exist on the blockchain, for example Synthetix's `ProxyERC20` - it exists in many forms (sUSD, SBTC..). If such a token is used as the `asset` or the `underlyingToken` even though the `claimRewards` method checks for this, they can still be stolen from the contract. This can happen because when calling `claimRewards` the `coin` address passed can be one of the other token addresses and then both `require` checks in the method will be passing successfully.

## Impact
This can result in a 100% rug, where users will lose all of their value and `rewardRecipient` will get all of it. It happens with special tokens only, hence Medium severity

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace the address check with a balance check - record the `asset` and `yt` balance of the contract before and after the transfer and assert that they are equal.
