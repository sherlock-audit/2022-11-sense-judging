# overflow caused by uint32(block.timestamp) breaks roll()

## Summary
An explicit conversion of `block.timestamp` to `uint32` can cause overflow in the year of 2106.
## Vulnerability Detail
`block.timestamp` returns a uint256 which has the value of the seconds that has elapsed since unix epoch. By casting the return to `uint32`, the maximum that will be allowed is 4294967295 which is February 7, 2106 6:28:16 AM. Once it goes after this date,  `uint32(block.timestamp)` will overflow which will cause `lastSettle` to be reseted to 0. This breaks the `roll()` functionality as   `  else if (lastSettle + cooldown > block.timestamp)` will always return True and thus causing a revert.

## Impact
User will be unable to roll the AutoRoller to the next series.


## Code Snippet
[AutoRoller.sol#L154-L167](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-sense/blob/main/contracts/src/AutoRoller.sol#L154-L167)
```solidity

    function roll() external {
        if (maturity != MATURITY_NOT_SET) revert RollWindowNotOpen();

        if (lastSettle == 0) {
            // If this is the first roll, lock some shares in by minting them for the zero address.
            // This prevents the contract from reaching an empty state during future active periods.
            deposit(firstDeposit, address(0));
        } else if (lastSettle + cooldown > block.timestamp) {
            revert RollWindowNotOpen();
        }

        lastRoller = msg.sender;
        adapter.openSponsorWindow();
    }
```


[AutoRoller.sol#L320](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-sense/blob/main/contracts/src/AutoRoller.sol#L320)

```solidity
        lastSettle = uint32(block.timestamp);
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
remove `uint32` explicit casting as lastSettle is in `uint256` and therefore it is not necessary to cast it explicitly
```solidity
        //lastSettle = uint32(block.timestamp);
          lastSettle = block.timestamp;
```
