# Anybody can make RollupPeriphery approve unlimited amount of ERC20 tokens

## Summary
The  [approve](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-sense/blob/main/contracts/src/RollerPeriphery.sol#L100-L102) function allows the caller to make the contract approve the target with arbitrary amount of tokens. 

Also , `payable` allows sending value to the contract , which is not accounted ,thereby resulting in permanent loss of funds

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
