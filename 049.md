# Return value is not used for ` RollerPeriphery.withdraw() `

## Summary

Return value is not used for ` RollerPeriphery.withdraw() `  

## Vulnerability Detail

The return value of RollerPeriphery.withdraw()  which represents the actual amount of tokens that were transferred is never used throughout the repository. This might cause discrepancy in the case where the original value of ` assets ` was ` uint256 maxSharesOut`  .

```
     function withdraw(ERC4626 vault, uint256 assets, address receiver, uint256 maxSharesOut) external returns (uint256 shares) {
        if ((shares = vault.withdraw(assets, receiver, msg.sender)) > maxSharesOut) {
            revert MaxSharesError();
        }
    }

```
