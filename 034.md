# lastRoller cannot call settle if the AutoRoller contract does not have "stakeSize" amount of adapter's stake token

## Summary

lastRoller cannot call settle if the AutoRoller contract does not have stakeSize amount of stake type token

## Vulnerability Detail

When the lastRoller can settle, thie code runs:

```solidity
  /// @notice Settle the active Series, transfer stake and ifees to the settler, and enter a cooldown phase.
  /// @dev Because the auto-roller is the series sponsor from the Divider's perspective, this.settle is the only entrypoint for athe lastRoller to settle during the series' sponsor window.
  ///      More info on the series lifecylce: https://docs.sense.finance/docs/series-lifecycle-detail/#phase-3-settling.
  function settle() public {
      if(msg.sender != lastRoller) revert InvalidSettler();

      uint256 assetBalPre = asset.balanceOf(address(this));
      divider.settleSeries(address(adapter), maturity); // Settlement will fail if maturity hasn't been reached.
      uint256 assetBalPost = asset.balanceOf(address(this));

      asset.safeTransfer(msg.sender, assetBalPost - assetBalPre); // Send issuance fees to the sender.

      (, address stake, uint256 stakeSize) = adapter.getStakeAndTarget();
      if (stake != address(asset)) {
          ERC20(stake).safeTransfer(msg.sender, stakeSize);
      }

      startCooldown();
  }
```

note this section.

```solidity
(, address stake, uint256 stakeSize) = adapter.getStakeAndTarget();
if (stake != address(asset)) {
    ERC20(stake).safeTransfer(msg.sender, stakeSize);
}
```

if the address stake does not match the asset in AutoRoller, we transfer the token to the lastRoller that can this function. However, the code does not check if the contract has sufficient balance of token type "stake". 

Consider this case:

asset token is set to address(A).

the stake type of token is address(B), stakeSize is 200 amount but autoRoller has 100 amount, the autoRoller does not sufficient balance complete the instruction:

```solidity
(, address stake, uint256 stakeSize) = adapter.getStakeAndTarget();
if (stake != address(asset)) {
    ERC20(stake).safeTransfer(msg.sender, stakeSize);
}
```

## Impact

function settle revert when lastRoller calling settle in AutoRoller.sol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project change the implementation from:

```solidity
(, address stake, uint256 stakeSize) = adapter.getStakeAndTarget();
if (stake != address(asset)) {
    ERC20(stake).safeTransfer(msg.sender, stakeSize);
}
```

to

```solidity
(, address stake, uint256 stakeSize) = adapter.getStakeAndTarget();
uint256 balance = ERC20(stake).balanceOf(this);
if (stake != address(asset) && balance >= stakeSize) {
    ERC20(stake).safeTransfer(msg.sender, stakeSize);
}
```
