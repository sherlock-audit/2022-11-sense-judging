# MEV on all `Balancer` actions - `join`, `exit`, `swap` are not slippage protected and can be sandwich attacked

## Summary
The codebase has an integration with Balancer vaults and makes heavy use of the `join`, `exit` and `swap` actions, but they have 0 slippage protection and can be sandwich attacked every time

## Vulnerability Detail
All Balancer actions usually take a "maxValueIn" or "minValueOut" parameter, but the code does not use them, either passing `0` or an empty value. This means every time a user interacts with the protocol through a method that does a Balancer action (almost all of the methods) he can get sandwich attacked and lose a lot of value. MEV bots are scanning the mempool and when they see a transaction with no slippage protection they have automations to take flash loans, so a large amount of liquidity, and sandwich attack those trades/actions, resulting in value stolen from users.

## Impact
The impact can be very big value losses for users of the protocol, since they can be sandwiched with flash loans on each of their transactions and have 90%+ slippage. Since no special conditions need to occur but users can lose value I choose High severity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a parameter to each function for `minValueOut` or `maxValueIn` or force users to use a private mempool (at least through a notice in docs)
