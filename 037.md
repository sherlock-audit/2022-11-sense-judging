# User can remove the adapter's stake token balance from the AutoRoller.sol by calling claimRewards

## Summary

User can remove the adapter's stake token address from the AutoRoller.sol by calling claimRewards

## Vulnerability Detail

Let us look into this piece of code:

```solidity
    /// @notice Transfer any token not included in the set {asset,yt,pt,space} to the rewards recipient.
    /// @param coin address of the coin to transfer out.
    function claimRewards(ERC20 coin) external {
        require(coin != asset);
        if (maturity != MATURITY_NOT_SET) {
            require(coin != ERC20(address(yt)) && coin != pt && coin != ERC20(address(space)));
        }
        coin.transfer(rewardRecipient, coin.balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
```

This function can be by anyone to help the rewardRecipient collect fee or it can be used to rescue the token that sent to the AutoRoller.sol contract.

However, the function  failed to check if the passed in coin is equal to the adapter's stake token.

```solidity
/// @param stakeSize the adapter's stake size.
function onSponsorWindowOpened(ERC20 stake, uint256 stakeSize) external {
  if (msg.sender != address(adapter)) revert OnlyAdapter();

  stake.safeTransferFrom(lastRoller, address(this), stakeSize);

  // Allow the Periphery to move stake for sponsoring the Series.
  stake.safeApprove(address(periphery), stakeSize);
```

Then User can remove the adapter's stake token balance from the AutoRoller.sol by calling claimRewards by passing in the address of adapter's take token any time no matter if the maturity is set or not.

## Impact

As the comment suggest, the adapter's stake token should be reserved for Periphery to move stake for sponsoring the Series.

Also in the function settle, stake token is also needed to pay the lastRoller.sol

```solidity
(, address stake, uint256 stakeSize) = adapter.getStakeAndTarget();
    if (stake != address(asset)) {
        ERC20(stake).safeTransfer(msg.sender, stakeSize);
}
```

If the user remove the adapter's stake token balance, Periphery cannot move stake for sponsoring the Series, lastRoller cannot settle the fund and getting the fee because the contract has no stake token balance.

If the user

## Recommendation

We recommend in the contract claimFee, add the check to make sure the passed in coin address is not equal to the stake token type.

```solidity
    /// @notice Transfer any token not included in the set {asset,yt,pt,space} to the rewards recipient.
    /// @param coin address of the coin to transfer out.
    function claimRewards(ERC20 coin) external {
        require(coin != asset, 'invalid token type');
        (, address stake, uint256 stakeSize) = adapter.getStakeAndTarget();
        require(coin != ERC20(stake), 'invalid token type');
        if (maturity != MATURITY_NOT_SET) {
            require(coin != ERC20(address(yt)) && coin != pt && coin != ERC20(address(space)));
        }
        coin.transfer(rewardRecipient, coin.balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
```
