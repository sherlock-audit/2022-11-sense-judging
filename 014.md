# Anyone can steal leftover/mistakenly sent tokens in `RollerPeriphery`

## Summary
The `RollerPeriphery` contract has a vulnerability in its `approve` method, allowing anyone to steal all of its ERC20 token balance.

## Vulnerability Detail
The method in the contract looks like this
```jsx
function approve(ERC20 token, address to, uint256 amount) public payable {
        token.safeApprove(to, amount);
    }
```
since it has no access control anyone can call it and approve his own address to be able to spend the tokens in this contract. Now if the periphery contract holds any value in ERC20 token, anyone can easily steal it. It can hold value for example if a user mistakenly sends value to it.

## Impact
The impact is easily stolen value from `RollerPeriphery` contract. Since it shouldn't normally hold value, but on the blockchain there are many examples of contract that "shouldn't hold value" but they end up doing, I consider this a viable vulnerability with a Medium severity.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add access control to the `approve` method so only an admin can use it.
