# First `ERC4626` deposit exploit can break share calculation

## Summary

`previewDeposit`  function follow the formula: 

```solidity
contracts/src/AutoRoller.sol:
  426  
  427:        // Calculate how much Target we'll end up joining the pool with, and use that to preview minted LP shares.
  428:        uint256 previewedLPBal = (assets - _getTargetForIssuance(ptReserves, targetReserves, assets, adapter.scaleStored()))
  429:        .mulDivDown(_space.adjustedTotalSupply(), targetReserves);
  430: 
  431:         // Shares represent proportional ownership of LP shares the vault holds.
  432:        return previewedLPBal.mulDivDown(totalSupply, _space.balanceOf(address(this)));
```

The share price always return 1:1 with asset token. If everything work normally, share price will slowly increase with time to 1:2 or 1:10 as more rewards coming in.

But right after ERC4626 contract creation, during first cycle, any user can deposit 1 share set totalSupply = 1. And transfer token to vault to inflate totalAssets before rewards kick in. (Basically, pretend rewards themselves before anyone can deposit in to get much better share price.)

This can inflate base share price as high as 1:1e18 early on, which force all subsequence deposit to use this share price as base.


## Vulnerability Detail
This exploit is unique to contract similar to ERC4626. It only works if starting supply equal 0 or very small number and rewards cycle is very short. Or everyone withdraws, total share supply become 0.



## Impact

New ERC4626 vault share price can be manipulated right after creation.
Which give early depositor greater share portion of the vault during the first cycle.

While deposit token also affected by rounding precision (due to exploit above) that always return lesser amount of share for user.


## Code Snippet

[AutoRoller.sol#L420](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-sense/blob/main/contracts/src/AutoRoller.sol#L420)


```solidity
contracts/src/AutoRoller.sol:
  419      ///      as a percentage of the total number of LP shares held in this contract to preview the number of new roller shares.
  420:     function previewDeposit(uint256 assets) public view override returns (uint256) {
  421:         if (maturity == MATURITY_NOT_SET) {
  422:             return super.previewDeposit(assets);
  423:         } else {
  424:             Space _space = space;
  425:             (uint256 ptReserves, uint256 targetReserves) = _getSpaceReserves();
  426: 
  427:             // Calculate how much Target we'll end up joining the pool with, and use that to preview minted LP shares.
  428:             uint256 previewedLPBal = (assets - _getTargetForIssuance(ptReserves, targetReserves, assets, adapter.scaleStored()))
  429:                 .mulDivDown(_space.adjustedTotalSupply(), targetReserves);
  430: 
  431:             // Shares represent proportional ownership of LP shares the vault holds.
  432:             return previewedLPBal.mulDivDown(totalSupply, _space.balanceOf(address(this)));
  433:         }
  434:     }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

This can be easily fix by making sure someone always deposited first so totalSupply become high enough that this exploit become irrelevant. Unless in unlikely case someone made arbitrage bot watching vault factory contract.
Just force deposit early token during vault construction as last resort.
