# Unchecked transfers

## Summary
Contract makes ERC20 transfer() without checking the result of the returned value.

## Vulnerability Detail
Multiple calls to transfer and transfer are frequently done without checking the results. For certain ERC20 tokens, if insufficient tokens are present, no revert occurs but a result of “false” is returned. 

## Impact
Certain losses for recipient of some erc20 tokens if insufficient tokens are present and no revert occurs
