# AutoRoller.sol#roll can revert if lastSettle is zero because solmate ERC4626 deposit revert if previewDeposit returns 0

## Summary

AutoRoller.sol#roll can revert if lastSettle is zero because solmate ERC4626 deposit revert if previewDeposit returns 0

## Vulnerability Detail

let us look into the implementation of function roll()

```solidity
  /// @notice Roll into the next Series if there isn't an active series and the cooldown period has elapsed.
  function roll() external {
      if (maturity != MATURITY_NOT_SET) revert RollWindowNotOpen();

      if (lastSettle == 0) {
          // If this is the first roll, lock some shares in by minting them for the zero address.
          // This prevents the contract from reaching an empty state during future active periods.
          deposit(firstDeposit, address(0));
      } else if (lastSettle + cooldown > block.timestamp) {
          revert RollWindowNotOpen();
      }

      lastRoller = msg.sender;
      adapter.openSponsorWindow();
  }
```

note, if lastSettle is 0, we deposit a small amount of token and mint shares to address(0)

```solidity
deposit(firstDeposit, address(0));
```

First deposit is a fairly small amount:

```solidity
firstDeposit  = (0.01e18 - 1) / scalingFactor + 1;
```

We can deposit from ERC4626 implementation:

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
    // Check for rounding error since we round down in previewDeposit.
    require((shares = previewDeposit(assets)) != 0, "ZERO_SHARES");

    // Need to transfer before minting or ERC777s could reenter.
    asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);

    _mint(receiver, shares);

    emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);

    afterDeposit(assets, shares);
}
```

note the restriction: 

```solidity
// Check for rounding error since we round down in previewDeposit.
require((shares = previewDeposit(assets)) != 0, "ZERO_SHARES");

// Need to transfer before minting or ERC777s could reenter.
asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);
```

if previewDeposit returns 0 shares, transaction revert. Can previewDeposit returns 0 shares? it is very possible.

```solidity
function previewDeposit(uint256 assets) public view override returns (uint256) {
    if (maturity == MATURITY_NOT_SET) {
        return super.previewDeposit(assets);
    } else {
        Space _space = space;
        (uint256 ptReserves, uint256 targetReserves) = _getSpaceReserves();

        // Calculate how much Target we'll end up joining the pool with, and use that to preview minted LP shares.
        uint256 previewedLPBal = (assets - _getTargetForIssuance(ptReserves, targetReserves, assets, adapter.scaleStored()))
            .mulDivDown(_space.adjustedTotalSupply(), targetReserves);

        // Shares represent proportional ownership of LP shares the vault holds.
        return previewedLPBal.mulDivDown(totalSupply, _space.balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
}
```

If (previewedLPBal * total) / space balance is truncated to 0, transaction revert. _space.balanceOf can certainly be inflated if malicious actor send the space token to the address manually. Or previewedLPBal * total could just be small and the division is truncated to 0.


## Impact

calling roll would revert and the new sponsored series cannot be started properly.

## Recommendation

We recommend the project not deposit a such small amount, or there could be a function that let admin gradually control how many tokens should we put in the first deposit.
